# HTML Forms 

## Text inputs 
Weâ€™ve seen how the **input** element can accept text values. There are several different type values that can be used, including:

   - **text**: for plain text
   - **password**: to obscure a password input field
   - **search**: to indicate the text field is used for searching a page/multiple pages
   - **url**: validates input as a URL address
   - **tel**: for inputting phone numbers
   - **email**: validates input as an email address<br/>
   
In the case of url and email, the browser will check to see if the input is a valid URL or email address.
