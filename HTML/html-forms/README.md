# HTML Forms 

## Text inputs 
Weâ€™ve seen how the ```<input>``` element can accept text values. There are several different type values that can be used, including:

   - **text**: for plain text
   - **password**: to obscure a password input field
   - **search**: to indicate the text field is used for searching a page/multiple pages
   - **url**: validates input as a URL address
   - **tel**: for inputting phone numbers
   - **email**: validates input as an email address<br/>
   
In the case of url and email, the browser will check to see if the input is a valid URL or email address.

## <textarea> 

If you want your user to be able to include new lines (by pressing return) in their text input, you can use a <textarea> element:

     <textarea id="multiLineInput"></textarea>

Notice how <textarea> elements have a closing tag. You can also specify the size of <textarea> by using the rows and cols attributes.

## Buttons 

A ```html <button>``` element should be used whenever you want to create a clickable button to perform some action on the page.

```button``` elements are simple to define, and have three different type values:
 - submit: submits form data to a server
 - reset: resets all the data in the current form
 - button: no default behavior. This type of button will be more useful when we begin our discussion of Javascript.
